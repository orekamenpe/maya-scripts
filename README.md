============

Here some you have some scripts where I have been working on:

generateCollision.py
--------------------

It creates 3 types of meshes around an object. It can be a sphere, a box or a cylinder.


renamer.py
----------

Renames the objects in the DAG. We can add suffix and prefix to that name or replace them


readXML.py & writeXML.py
------------------------

2 scripts to write the content of a scene into a xml file and read that information.
