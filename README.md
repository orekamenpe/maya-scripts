maya-scripts
============

Here some you have some scripts where I have been working on:

### Old Scripts ###

**generateCollision.py :**
    It creates 3 types of meshes around an object. It can be a sphere, a box or a cylinder.

**renamer.py :**
    Renames the objects in the DAG. We can add suffix and prefix to that name or replace them.

**readXML.py & writeXML.py :**
    2 scripts to write the content of a scene into a xml file and read that information.

<br>

### Maya Python Plugins ###

**basePluginCommand.py :**
The common structure base for the maya plugins in python.

**printHierarchy.py :**
A basic plugin showing all the scene objects, type and path.

**vertexParticle.py :**
This plugin sets a particle in each vertex of a polymesh.
